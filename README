Project: 
This project we were tasked to create an experience website to show people hidden places in a city of our choice. 

I chose to use hidden street art in Aarhus. 

Specifically I made a website where you can tour Aarhus and find art which is hidden and displayed on the home pages map and also submit art that you find elsewhere. 
this would then progress you in recieving badges and titles that you could show off to your other friends who use the website as well. 


User instructions: 
initially the program should be viewed in 1920 by 1080 pixels,

the upload button in the bottom left has an interface which currently only works for this aspect ratio

the rest of the document can be viewed from nearly any width and height 

when viewing the desktop navigation dont use device emulation as it doesnt display the hover animation of the navigation


UNfortunately Javascript ffeatures only work on the home page, I have copy and pasted the same code from the main page and the files are linked the same but it doesnt seem to work the same
